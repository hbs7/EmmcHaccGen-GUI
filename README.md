The EmmcHaccGen is a Command Line Interface app, and many people make mistakes while trying to run the app. 
So I made a simple GUI Interface for it. 

# HOW TO INSTALL THIS APP

- Download the EmmcHaccGen from this link https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/EmmcHaccGen/releases
- Drag or copy the GUI into the EmmcHaccGen folder

# HOW TO USE THIS APP

- Download the .NET Desktop Runtime from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1 and install it
- Download the firmware files from https://darthsternie.net/switch-firmwares/
- Get the console keys using the Lockpick_RCM Payload, use my HATS pack here https://github.com/sthetix/HATS/releases
- Create a new folder inside the EmmcHaccGen folder and name it FW
- Extract that firmware files to the FW folder
- Run the EmmcHaccGenGUI app
- Choose the console type, select the FW folder, select the prod.keys, select the EmmcHaccGen app, then press GO
